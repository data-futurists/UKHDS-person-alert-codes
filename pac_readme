# Person Alert Code Standard

**Proposed Sector-Wide Standard for Housing Providers**  
Aligned with HACT Housing Data Standards  
**Version:** Draft v1.0  
**Author:** Elena Iurco  
**Date:** 25 July 2025

---

## Overview

This repository contains the proposed **Person Alert Code** data model and design documentation intended for use by housing providers across the UK social housing sector. It aligns with HACT Housing Data Standards and supports emerging regulatory requirements.

The standard aims to provide a structured and interoperable way to capture and manage alerts related to tenants’ health, risk, or support needs, allowing better-informed operational decisions and safeguarding.

---

## What's Included

- `schema.sql` — SQL table definitions for `person_alert` and `person_alert_codes`
- `design-decisions.md` — Detailed documentation of the design rationale behind each field
- Example use cases and implementation notes (TBC)

---

## Data Tables

### 1. `person_alert_codes`
Defines the standardised codes for various alerts, such as medical conditions, risk factors, or environmental sensitivities.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `alert_code_id` | Unique internal ID |
| `alert_code` | Top-level grouping code (e.g. MED1) |
| `alert_subcode` | Detailed identifier (e.g. MED1.01) |
| `alert_category` | Broad classification (e.g. Medical, Risk) |
| `alert_name` | Group name (e.g. Respiratory Condition) |
| `alert_subname` | Specific condition (e.g. Asthma) |
| `is_critical` | Boolean flag for life-critical risks |
| `is_awaab_relevant` | Boolean flag for alerts related to Awaab’s Law |
| `repairs_impact` | High/Medium/Low/None |
| `support_required` | Optional text instructions (e.g. Use interpreter) |

---

### 2. `person_alert`
Stores individual tenant alert records, linked to a person and an alert code.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `person_alert_id` | Primary key |
| `person_id` | FK to the person table |
| `alert_code_id` | FK to person_alert_codes |
| `alert_description` | Free text notes (optional) |
| `alert_source` | Source of alert (e.g. NHS, GP, Social Worker) |
| `created_by` | Creator name |
| `source_description` | Specific person or agency |
| `informed_resident` | Boolean |
| `alert_progress` | Enum: Stable, Improving, Deteriorating, Fluctuating, Unknown |
| `alert_duration_type` | Enum: Long Term, Temporary, Unknown |
| `alert_duration` | Duration in days (optional) |
| `start_date`, `end_date`, `review_date` | Key dates |
| `active` | Boolean flag for current status |
| `last_updated`, `updated_by` | Audit fields |

## Key Design Principles

- **Sector Alignment**: Built with HACT Data Standards and MHCLG guidance in mind.
- **Flexibility + Standardisation**: Balances free text fields for local context with standardised codes for analytics.
- **Awaab’s Law Compliance**: Enables tagging and prioritisation of alerts that require urgent housing-related intervention.

---

## Use Cases

- Flagging tenants with **respiratory vulnerabilities** affected by damp or mould.
- Identifying **critical medical conditions** requiring housing adaptations.
- Recording **behavioural risks** for contractor safety.
- Managing **temporary vulnerabilities** (e.g. post-surgery, pregnancy).
- Supporting **translation needs**, communication preferences, or safeguarding alerts.
